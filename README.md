## Instructions for replicating the experiment

### 1. Experiment execution

Experiment-runner is used for automating the execution of the experiments.

#### Infrastructure setup

The experiment uses the version of TTS available in the [TrainTicket](./TrainTicket) folder. It includes the integration of the TTS with a selection of four monitoring tools (ELK stack, Netdata, Prometheus and Zipkin) and the set of a set of 34 load test scripts generated with [K6](https://k6.io/). Please check [this readme](./TrainTicket/readme.md) file for the detailed instructions about how to setup and deploy the various versions of the TTS used in this experiment. 

The pipeline can be triggered using Experiment-Runner with the `RunnerConfig-monitoring.py` specification. Please follow
the instructions in the project [README](https://github.com/S2-group/experiment-runner).

#### Required software
1. **K6** is required to be installed on the machine for running the K6 load test scripts.
2. Python3, required by Experiment-Runner
3. [Experiment-Runner](https://github.com/S2-group/experiment-runner) - Note that the framework is not supported on
   Windows. 

### 2. Data analysis

Data processing and data analysis scripts for data obtained during the experiment performed on the [Train Ticket system](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket) are available in the [data](./data) folder.
